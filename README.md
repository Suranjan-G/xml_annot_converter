# xml_annot_converter
A single python file intended to convert annotation format from XML to a CSV for a group of images (configured to work with the KAIST Multispectral dataset)
This file is in ipynb format. Change it to pure .py if needed

First block contains a command to understand the structure of a valid XML file. Once that is obtained, and the features necessary for the CSV file are identified, use those in the 5th block.
Vary the name to the XML files as needed, in the 4th block.

The final CSV (created from KAIST) is also included.
